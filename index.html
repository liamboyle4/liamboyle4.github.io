                    <p class="section-subheading text-muted">Hi! My name is Liam and I am currently an Electrical Engineering student at Virginia Tech with a focus in micro/nanosystems. I like programming and working hands-on with electronics, and I am currently interested in the semiconductor and embedded systems industries. In my free time, I like to watch hockey and football, go for scenic drives, and ski, and I also really enjoy traveling and trying new things. I've listed some of my recent projects here and hope to expand this page as I progress through my career. Feel free to check them out and contact me (socials at the bottom) if you have any questions or would like to discuss them further!</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A 45nm ALU with logical and arithmetic operations.</p>
                                    <p>This was the final project of my VLSI class during my senior year. Our group was tasked with designing and simulating a simplified ALU using a 45nm process (FreePDK45) in Cadence. The ALU required a 4-bit multiplier, logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply), and was to be optimized for power, area, and delay. I was tasked with creating the multiplier and overall ALU schematics and layouts.</p>
                                    <!-- Multiplier-->
                                    <h3 class="my-3">Multiplier</h3>
                                    <p>For the multiplier, I chose to use combinational logic which contained 3 4-bit adders and 16 AND gates. The 4-bit adders were ripple-carry adders, and we chose this over a faster architecture like a carry look-ahead adder because the trade-off between the reduced delay and increased area and power consumption was not worth it. The inputs to the adders are delayed by AND gates and other adders, so additional logic that reduces the time of the addition using the inputs would be inefficient.</p>

                                    <p>I designed the layout to be as space efficient as possible and to have the inputs and outputs be easily accessible. I also tried to keep the overall shape as square as possible, which is common practice in layout design to reduce area and help it fit in higher level layouts. The layout ended up being 13.98 um long and 13.16 um wide.</p>

                                    <!-- ALU-->
                                    <h3 class="my-3">ALU</h3>
                                    <p>The ALU contained 4-bit AND/OR/XOR/NOT logic, my 4-bit multiplier, a 4-bit adder/subtractor, select logic which determines which operation the add/subtract unit will perform, and a control unit. The control unit is made up of four 8x1 multiplexers that determine which output to select based on 3 given select bits. Each of the 4-bit logic/arithmetic units have a 4-bit output except for the multiplier, which has an 8-bit output. To account for this, the first four bits of the ALU output were fed from the control unit output, and the last four bits were taken directly from the multiplier. The user would need to decide if the last four bits of the output were useful based on whether or not the multiply operation was chosen.</p>
                                    <figure>
                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/Arithmetic Logic Unit/ALU Schematic.png" alt="Image" />

                                    </figure>
                                    <p>The ALU layout contained many sub-units and required careful routing and positioning to keep the design compact. One way I did this was by splitting up the 4-bit logic units and instead grouping them by each bit. This meant that, for example, the 0th bit output logic of the AND, OR, NOT, and XOR  gates were grouped together and fed into the first multiplexer of the control unit. The layout ended up being 40.33 um long by 33.3 um wide, and from the post simulation results we determined the power consumption to be 140 uW and the critical-path propagation delay to be 750.02 ps.</p>

                                    <p>Overall, I was happy with the design of our team’s ALU, but there were some improvements I would’ve liked to make if we had more time. One of those would’ve been adding flip-flops to the inputs and outputs to allow for state management through a clock. It also would’ve been nice to make the control unit and adder/subtractor layouts more square to reduce the area of the ALU layout. Depending on the use case, we also could’ve added additional logic that would set the 4 most significant bits to 0 if any operation other than multiply was selected, since multiply is the only operation with an 8-bit output.</p>

                                    <p>This was a semester long project that I worked on with one other teammate. This project was built using only basic circuit components, breadboards, an Arduino Uno, and a small OLED display. We were tasked with creating a three band graphic equalizer, amplifying that signal using a class-D amplifier, filtering out the high frequency components, and finally displaying the strength of each band using a spectrogram on the OLED display.</p>

                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/Audio Amplifier/Graphic Equalizer Circuit.png" alt="Image" style="width: 45%;"/>

                                    <p>We designed our graphic equalizer by creating three filters and summing their outputs twice: once at 0 degrees and once at 180 degrees, with the original input using an LF356n op-amp. Potentiometers were used to adjust the difference of each filter's summing component, and the filter outputs canceled out at the potentiometer's center point. This allowed for a clean output regardless of how the bands were adjusted, as opposed to simply summing the filter outputs, which would result in unwanted drops or peaks in the frequency response. We chose the center frequencies of the bass, mid-range, and treble bands to be 115 Hz, 1 kHz, and 6.5 kHz, respectively.</p>
                                    <figure>
                                        <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/Audio Amplifier/Equalizer Results.png" alt="Image" />

                                    <p>I was overall happy with the results of our equalizer. For each band, it achieved a maximum cut of about -4.5 dB, a maximum boost of about 3 dB, and stayed at nearly 0 dB with the potentiometer in the neutral position. Since this equalizer used standard op-amps, it could not drive the load by itself, which required us to design a class-D amplifier.</p>
                                    <!-- Class-D Amp-->
                                    <h3 class="my-3">Class-D Amplifier</h3>
                                    <p>The overall design plan of our class-D amplifier was to pulse-width modulate the input, send the PWM signal through a switching stage of MOSFETs, and finally filter out the high-frequency components. This design ended up being much more involved than we anticipated, especially with the limited equipment we were permitted to use.</p>
                                    <p>First, we needed to create a triangular carrier frequency that would be compared to the input and would result in a PWM signal. We wanted the carrier frequency to be as high as possible so that most of the audible range (20 Hz - 20 kHz) would be unaffected by the low-pass filter. The Arduino Uno was the source of this frequency, and unfortunately, it is only able to generate a 1 kHz square wave by default. To fix this, we set the prescaler of the output pin's timer to 1, which essentially gave us the Arduino's system clock at about 60 kHz. This signal was unipolar, so we scaled it to -5V to 5V using a comparator op-amp. Next, knowing that the integral of a square wave is a triangle wave, we built a simple op-amp integrator to get our final triangular carrier wave. Finally, we sent this wave and the input into a comparator op-amp to get our 60 kHz PWM signal.</p>

                                    <p>For the switching stage, we tried to keep the device characteristics as close as possible by using two NMOSs instead of an NMOS and PMOS. This now requires a second inverted PWM signal, so we simply duplicated the comparator circuit but switched the input terminals. The devices were still slightly mismatched since we were using discrete components, and this affected the timing of the switching, causing a large amount of shoot-through current, poor power efficiency, and distortion in the output. To combat this, we clamped the triangle wave going into the inverted comparator by -1V in order to add dead time; a period where both PWM signals are low and both NMOSs are off.</p>

                                    <p>Finally, we had our amplified output with low distortion and only about 25mA of shoot-through current. We built a low-pass filter with a break frequency of 16 kHz that achieved an attenuation of around -33 dB at our carrier frequency, 60 kHz. The op-amps we had could not drive the current required by the load, and we only needed negative or zero gain, so we decided to use a passive filter.</p>

                                    <p>The final part of this project involved programming a spectrogram on our Arduino to display the frequency response of the output on our small OLED screen. The simplest approach would have been to display the strength of the signals from the three filters. However, we opted for a more thorough approach and performed a real-time Fourier analysis. After testing our Arduino, we found that it can read our output about 9000 times per second. According to Nyquist's theorem, this meant that we could only accurately analyze up to 4.5 kHz. We utilized the “fix_fft.h” Arduino library to perform the Fourier analysis, which returns two arrays of 128 samples, one with real values and one with imaginary values. We then divided the first 64 samples into three sections (since the other 64 samples are beyond 4.5 kHz) and plotted the averages of the magnitudes of the samples in each section. This process resulted in our three-band spectrogram, which is displayed below.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A Bootstrap-themed portfolio</p>
                                    <p>I designed this website by starting with a free template from the Bootstrap website and personalizing it using HTML and JavaScript. This allowed me to not only get the website up faster, but also to utilize the Bootstrap framework for making the website more responsive, efficient, and visually pleasing. Once I finished designing the page, I hosted it on GitHub, as it is free and useful for hosting static webpages like this one.</p>

                                    <p>I was able to utilize some of the skills I picked up in earlier computer science courses, however this was my first time using Bootstrap and I learned some valuable skills from making this page. Overall, making this was a fun learning experience and I feel more comfortable designing websites by myself.</p>

                                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">A prototype for a robot that delivers food across campus</p>
                                    <p>This was one of my first college projects, and my team was tasked with designing a prototype for a robot that could deliver food from campus dining halls to the dorm buildings within a $60 budget. This idea is gaining popularity and can be seen at some colleges like the University of Kentucky and USC. </p>
                                    <p>The team was made up of six people and was broken into three subteams, and my subteam was responsible for providing the electronics and software to control the robot wirelessly through Bluetooth. We opted to utilize an Arduino for handling computations and wireless communication and an L298N motor driver for motor control, since an Arduino alone couldn't deliver sufficient power to the motors. We also used an HC-06 Bluetooth module to act as the middleman between the Arduino and the device we were controlling the robot with. The entire system was powered by just one 9V battery.</p>

                                    <p>We programmed the Arduino to communicate with the driver’s four input ports depending on what the driving instruction was, which could be forward, backwards, left, right, or stop. We started with sending commands to the Arduino via a wired serial connection from a laptop, and once we got that working, we connected the Bluetooth module to the Arduino’s RX/TX pins. All that was left after that was to configure our chosen command characters to each control on a Bluetooth app, which can be seen below. Then we could simply connect the app to our Bluetooth module and send signals to the Arduino, which would control the motors.</p>
